# Advent of Code - Day 2 (Password Philosophy)

Day two was checking for character matches in strings! Initially pondered the use of regexes for Part 1, and I sure am happy I didn't start down that rabbit hole

Instead decided to keep it simple and loop over the characters in the strings. Not pretty but it worked!

Got to learn about a simpler way of reading files with the Scanner library and the differences between runes and bytes in Go.
